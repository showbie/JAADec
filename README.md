JAAD is an AAC decoder and MP4 demultiplexer library written completely in Java. It uses no native libraries, is platform-independent and portable. It can read MP4 container from almost every input-stream (files, network sockets etc.) and decode AAC-LC (Low Complexity) and HE-AAC (High Efficiency/AAC+).

This library is available on Bintray's `jcenter` as a Maven/Gradle download.<br>
